# Dotfiles From My Windows PC

These are my working Windows PC dotfiles that have never been touched by anything Windowsey

### \*\* **Never touch linux subsystem files with Windowsey software/processes or BAD things will happen (just keep Windows out)** \*\*
***Disclaimer: By using these files or following my documentation you acknowledge the risk involved. I take no responsibility and will not be held liable for software damage, hardware damage, or any other resulting damage to the device you use these dotfiles, or instructions, on.***

This all sounds very scary, but I have never had an issue with corrupting my Linux Subsystem. &mdash; That being said, I have always been very anal about only using a bash instance in my terminal to do anything in the Linux Subsystem.

##### The Consequences of Getting it Wrong:

>Doing something as simple as using your Windows File Explorer to look in your Linux ~/home directory (or anywhere in the Linux subsystem) will most likely cause Windows to take a dump in Linux&mdash;corrupting it and potentially turning your computer into a paperweight.

> **To safely modify files in the Linux Subsystem for Windows do everything through a bash instance in your preferred terminal/command-prompt (better get familiar with Unix commands)**<br>
>- **These can be helpful: `$ cd`, `$ cp`, `$ rm -rf`**
>
>**Edit files through vim or nano while in a bash instance too**
>
>***EVERYTHING must be done in a bash instance***

If you don't know what this means or what your doing...just don't do it...
