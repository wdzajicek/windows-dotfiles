# Dotfiles From My Windows PC

**For in-depth Instructions and documenation on installing dotfiles on Windows go to the dotfile section in my [Windows Development Page - Dotfiles](https://wdzajicek.github.io/portfolio/windows-dev.html#dotfiles)**

#### \*\* **Never touch linux subsystem files with Windowsey software/processes or BAD things will happen (just keep Windows out)** \*\*

***Documentation on how I set up my Windows dev environment is also available on my [Windows Development Page](https://wdzajicek.github.io/portfolio/windows-dev.html)***

These are my working Windows PC dotfiles that have never been touched by anything Windowsey

If you don't know what this means or what your doing...just don't do it..
